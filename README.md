# Assessment 2: Plan and Implement a Terminal Application

## Statement of purpose and scope

The purpose of this terminal app is to allow users to gain valuable information about their health and tips for maintaining their health goals such as losing, gaining or maintaining their weight. 

This health application will:
- Provide users with their Body Mass Index based on user input of their height and weight. 
  The user will be allocated within the ranges of underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. 
- Calculate their daily estimated energy requirement (Kcals/day) for the selected user preference of gaining, losing or maintaining weight.
- Provide recommended macronutrient intakes (protein, fats, carbohydrates) based on their daily estimated energy requirements. 

This app is developed as a reference for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of their health status and provide simple dietary advice for users who wish to improve on their health goals in regards to weight. This app also provides an estimated reference for users who wish to plan their meals specific to each macronutrient in order for them to achieve their goals such as bulking, cutting or maintaining their current weight. 

Users will be able to check their Body Mass Index to see if they are within healthy weight ranges. Furthermore, the user will be asked what their goal is in terms of their weight (to gain, lose or maintain weight). 

Once an answer has been determined, the user will be provided with a daily estimated energy requirement (Kcals/day) specific to their physical activity level, height, weight and gender. 

To break this down further, The user will also be provided with a basic guideline of how many grams of each macronutrient (protein, fats and carbohydrates) they should be consuming. This allows users to gain insight when planning meals in the future. 

Due to the age restrictions of the formula used for Basal Metabolic Rate and Body Mass index Levels, only adults over the age of 18 can use this health app. 

It is also recommended that individuals who are weight training be advised that inaccuracies can occur with their Body Mass Index levels due to the misconception of heavier muscle mass being extra unwanted weight leading to resulting outputs being overweight or obese.
