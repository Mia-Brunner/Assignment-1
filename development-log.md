# Development Log 

## Status update:

15/11/19

 Currently, I have completed a basic plan of my app covering the purpose, scope and flowcharts. I will still need to add onto my software development plan and further discuss its features and interactions with the user. 

 I have also completed a rough skeleton of my app and have included its key features of BMI calculator, Estimated Energy intake calculator and a Macronutrient calculator. I will still need to apply more gems such as colorize, artii and possibly lolcat to my app. I will also need to create 2 test applications assessing my main components. 

 The challenges that i currently face is error handling and i believe i will have difficultly applying an agrument or a flag to my design later on in the future.

  Currently, I have had issues with creating a command line argument that runs succinctly with gets.chomp. I was told by our teacher that Ruby occasionally doesn't allow for that so i had to create a different method called STDIN.gets. I was stuck on this issue all day as i thought there was an error in my code.

  I am now working on testing my formulas to ensure that they are working appropriately. I will still need to work on my presentation, some parts of my development plan and the help file. I will also need to make changes to my features as I don't believe my answers were relevant to the question asked.
