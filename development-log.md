# Development Log 

## Status update:

15/11/19

 Currently, I have completed a basic plan of my app covering the purpose, scope and flowcharts. I will still need to add onto my software development plan and further discuss its features and interactions with the user. 

 I have also completed a rough skeleton of my app and have included its key features of BMI calculator, Estimated Energy intake calculator and a Macronutrient calculator. I will still need to apply more gems such as colorize, artii and possibly lolcat to my app. I will also need to create 2 test applications assessing my main components. 

 The challenges that i currently face is error handling and i believe i will have difficultly applying an agrument or a flag to my design later on in the future.
